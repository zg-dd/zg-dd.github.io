[{"content":"Regex Concepts\r[] Use [] to match a single character inside the brackets. For example, [abc] matches any one of a, b, or c. In the string \u0026ldquo;abcdabcdbd\u0026rdquo; it matches a, b, c, a, b, c, b. It matches one character at a time and does not merge them. [abc]+ means one or more occurrences of any character in a, b, c. In the same string it matches abc, abc, b. In other words, it matches any of a, b, c one or more times, and consecutive matches are grouped as one string.\n\\ \\ is the escape character. Common escapes include \\n (newline), \\t (tab), \\r (carriage return), \\b (backspace), \\f (form feed), \\v (vertical tab), ' (single quote), \u0026quot; (double quote), and \\ (backslash). Regex has many other symbols; the image below lists them. Important: In regex, some escapes like \\b, \\f, \\n, \\t, \\r, ' can be written directly, e.g. regex=\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;; that matches a newline. regex=\u0026quot;\\\\n\u0026quot; also matches a newline. But for symbols like \\w, \\W, \\B, \\S, \\s, you must write regex=\u0026quot;\\\\w\u0026quot; to be valid; otherwise it fails. When you copy these escapes, \\ is often automatically doubled. So I recommend using \\\\ when you need a literal backslash in regex. Note: Not every escape needs to be doubled. For example, to match a double quote, you should not write regex=\u0026quot;\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot;. That would be interpreted incorrectly. Use regex=\u0026quot;\\\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot;. Using regex=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; also works. If you want to match a backslash itself, in Java you would write regex=\u0026quot; \\\\\\\\ \u0026ldquo; (four backslashes). The first two represent the escape for , and the last two represent another literal \\ (this is my understanding; the expression is correct). By the same logic, to match \\, you would write regex=\u0026rdquo; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \u0026ldquo;.\n| This symbol means OR. For x|y, it matches x or y. The | operator has higher precedence than x,y. For regex = \u0026ldquo;[a][b]|[c][d]\u0026rdquo;, it matches \u0026ldquo;ab\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cd\u0026rdquo;, not \u0026ldquo;a(b|c)d\u0026rdquo;.\n?\u0026lt;= and ?= These are lookaround tokens. They match a symbol without including it in the result. Example: to extract the text inside double quotes, for String str = \u0026ldquo;he says,\\\u0026ldquo;Hello,Java!\\\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;; You can use: regex = \u0026ldquo;(?\u0026lt;=\\\u0026quot;)[^\\\u0026quot;]+(?=\\\u0026quot;)\u0026rdquo;. Here, (?\u0026lt;=\\\u0026rdquo;) matches a quote but does not include it, [^\\\u0026rdquo;]+ matches one or more non-quote characters, and (?=\\\u0026rdquo;) matches the closing quote without including it. These two are usually used together: one before and one after.\nNote: The single and double quotes above are English quotes. Some symbols may appear as Chinese punctuation due to escaping; keep that in mind when reading. That is all for now; I will add more later if I find new points.\nRegex Symbol Table\r","date":"2020-04-27T18:00:00+08:00","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/stu/regular/","title":"Regex Basics: Common Symbols Explained ([] \\\\ | (?\u003c=))"}]
